        "reviewBody": "I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of &quot;Another Country&quot; meets &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; as the story of &quot;Ollie&quot; (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal &quot;Felix&quot; (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of &quot;Felix&quot; lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous &quot;Farleigh&quot; (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. Its a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and &quot;Ollie&quot; proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things arent all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Williss score all add a degree of richness to a story that isnt as derivative as I feared. I cant think its a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",

When I see Harlan Coben I dont expect the reinvention of the wheel, but I know that usually Ill be moderately entertained for 6-8 episodes. This is not highly original but its better than half the stuff that Netflix has been putting out lately. Between the ridiculous &quot;action&quot; movies, the unfunny comedy specials and the terribly dubbed series there isnt much worth watching.\n\nThe one thing that consistently annoyed me was the cop who continued to press on despite experiencing black outs. Come on! As a retired LEO this idea that law enforcement will stay on the case through any injury or illness always bothers me. If you have a broken limb, youre at home. If youre at work in any capacity its assigned to a desk. To think that someone would refuse to be sidelined when theyre experiencing blackouts is absurd.",

And I expect the plot of the second half will be identical too. So if you have ever seen any of those and a spaceship taking off, you dont need to see this movie (OK, some of the spaceship imagery is very good). But I have to wonder whether anyone was actually paid for &quot;writing&quot; the script :-)",

Those mundane scenes should fade into the background, but no, Penas signature has to be forcefully stamped on everything. Simping, simping, and more simping - its become a parade of tired tropes. Money Heist set a bar, and this feels like a heart-wrenching downgrade. If this trend persists, its on the fast track to becoming a Bollywood melodrama. As someone genuinely disappointed, I hoped for more than this. Kudos, Alex, for turning what could have been a riveting tale into a predictable saga.",

        "reviewBody": "If youve seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you havent seen any of his films, buckle up. Thats all Ill say.\n\nPoor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. Its trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.\n\nPoor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way thats both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called &quot;polite society&quot;. Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stones career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we havent seen from any actor in a long time.\n\nPoor Things holds nothing back. Theres a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps its the most realistic sex weve ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimoss entire career. Mark Ruffalos performance as Duncan is by far the years best comedic performance.\n\nIf youre looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, youve found it right here.",

But diving into the first two episodes surprised me-it brought back the Percy Jackson vibes, nailing visuals, characters, and the storyline. Despite visual tweaks, the characters personalities felt spot-on. Percy is undeniably Percy, Annabeth is herself, and Grover has some extra depth. Im really looking forward to the next episodes! The quality and attention to detail exceeded my expectations, promising an engaging series that captures the essence of the beloved books.",

With all the effort in building up the complex, intriguing plot, I can see how a definitive ending would be difficult or impossible to create. It felt like rather than make any attempt, they just chose an abrupt, inexplicable stopping point versus an actual ending. Many plot elements were developed and left hanging.\n\nThe first two hours Id rate this an 8 or a 9. The last 10 minutes a 2 at most.",
